=head1 Perl bindings for the CommonMark C library

This module is wrapper around I<libcmark>, the official CommonMark C library.

=head2 Installation from a CPAN tarball

If I<libcmark> is in a standard location:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Otherwise:

    perl Makefile.PL \
        INC="-I/prefix/include" \
        LIBS="-L/prefix/lib -lcmark"
    make
    make test
    make install

See the documentation of I<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> for additional options.
The I<PERL_MM_OPT> environment variable is especially useful.

    export PERL_MM_OPT='INC="-I..." LIBS="-L... -lcmark"'

=head2 Build from a repository checkout 

You need I<Dist::Zilla> with the external plugins I<MakeMaker::Awesome> and
I<PodWeaver>. Then you can build and test with I<dzil>:

    dzil test
    dzil build
