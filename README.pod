=head1 Perl bindings for the CommonMark C library

This module is a wrapper around I<libcmark>, the official CommonMark C
library.

=head2 Installation of libcmark

    git clone git@github.com:jgm/CommonMark.git
    cd CommonMark
    make [INSTALL_PREFIX=/prefix]
    make test
    make install

See the I<libcmark> README for details.

=head2 Installation from a CPAN tarball

If I<libcmark> is in a standard location:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Otherwise:

    perl Makefile.PL \
        INC="-I/prefix/include" \
        LIBS="-L/prefix/lib -lcmark"
    make
    make test
    make install

See the documentation of I<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> for additional options.
The I<PERL_MM_OPT> environment variable is especially useful.

    export PERL_MM_OPT='INC="-I..." LIBS="-L... -lcmark"'

=head2 Build from a repository checkout 

You need I<Dist::Zilla> with the external plugin I<MakeMaker::Awesome>.
Then you can build and test with I<dzil>:

    dzil test
    dzil build
